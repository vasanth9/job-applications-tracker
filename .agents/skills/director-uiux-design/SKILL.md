- Background processing and sync

### Native vs. Cross-Platform Decision Framework

| Factor | Native | Cross-Platform |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Performance-critical | ✓ Preferred | Consider carefully |
| Platform-specific features | ✓ Required | Limited support |
| Time to market | Slower | ✓ Faster |
| Team expertise | Specialized | ✓ Shared codebase |
| Long-term maintenance | Higher cost | ✓ Unified updates |

## Marketplace Expertise

### Two-Sided Platform Dynamics

#### Supply Side (Sellers/Providers)
- Low-friction onboarding and listing creation
- Inventory and availability management
- Pricing tools and competitive insights
- Performance analytics and growth recommendations
- Payment and payout transparency

#### Demand Side (Buyers/Consumers)

- Trust signals and social proof
- Frictionless checkout and payment
- Order tracking and communication
- Returns, refunds, and dispute resolution

#### Platform Governance
- Content moderation and policy enforcement
- Quality standards and rating systems
- Fraud prevention UX
- Balancing supply/demand through design incentives

### Marketplace Growth Levers

| Lever | Design Impact |
|-------|---------------|
| Liquidity | Search relevance, matching algorithms UI |
| Trust | Reviews, verification badges, guarantees |
