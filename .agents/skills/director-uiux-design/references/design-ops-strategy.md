## Strategic Planning

### Annual Design Strategy

#### Components
1. **Design vision statement**: North star for the year
2. **Strategic pillars**: 3-5 focus areas
3. **Key initiatives**: Major projects per pillar
4. **Success metrics**: How we measure progress
5. **Resource plan**: Headcount, budget, timelines

#### Sample Pillars
- Platform consistency (design system maturity)
- User acquisition (conversion optimization)
- Retention & engagement (feature depth)
- Operational excellence (process improvement)
- Team growth (hiring, skills development)

### Quarterly OKR Framework

**Objective Format**: Qualitative, inspirational goal
**Key Result Format**: Quantitative, measurable outcome

**Example OKRs**

*Objective: Establish world-class mobile experience*
- KR1: Achieve 4.7+ App Store rating (from 4.3)
- KR2: Reduce checkout abandonment by 20%
- KR3: Launch redesigned home screen with 15% engagement lift

*Objective: Scale design operations for hypergrowth*
- KR1: Hire 5 designers while maintaining quality bar
- KR2: Reduce design-to-dev handoff time by 30%
- KR3: Achieve 80% design system adoption across all products

### Roadmap Integration

#### Design Roadmap Tiers
1. **Committed** (0-3 months): Locked scope, active development
2. **Planned** (3-6 months): High confidence, scoping in progress
3. **Exploratory** (6-12 months): Strategic bets, research phase

#### Alignment Rituals
- Weekly: Design team standup, project status updates
- Bi-weekly: Cross-functional roadmap sync

## Budgeting & Resource Planning

### Budget Categories

| Category | Typical % | Includes |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Headcount | 70-80% | Salaries, benefits, contractors |
| Tools | 10-15% | Software licenses, subscriptions |
| Research | 5-10% | User testing, recruitment, incentives |
| Professional Dev | 3-5% | Conferences, courses, books |
| Misc | 2-3% | Equipment, team events |

### Headcount Planning

**Ratios to Monitor**
- Designer : Engineer (1:8 to 1:5 typical, 1:4 design-led)
- Designer : PM (1:2 to 1:1)
- Manager : IC (1:6 to 1:8)

**Headcount Request Template**
1. Business justification
2. Scope of work
3. Level and skills required
4. Timeline and urgency
5. Alternative options considered

## Vendor & Agency Management

### When to Use External Partners
- Specialized skills (3D, motion, brand)
- Capacity overflow
- Fresh perspective on stale problems
- Speed for time-sensitive projects

### Engagement Models
- **Project-based**: Fixed scope, deliverables, timeline
- **Retainer**: Ongoing hours, flexible allocation
- **Staff augmentation**: Embedded contractor as team member

### Selection Criteria
1. Portfolio relevance to project type
2. Cultural fit and communication style
3. Process compatibility
4. Pricing and value
5. References from similar clients

### Working Effectively with Agencies
- Clear brief with defined success criteria
- Single point of contact on each side
- Regular check-ins (weekly minimum)
- Explicit feedback with revision limits
- Knowledge transfer at project end

## Design Debt Management

### What is Design Debt?
Accumulated UX/UI inconsistencies, outdated patterns, and unresolved usability issues that slow future development and degrade user experience.

### Debt Categories
1. **Visual inconsistency**: Off-brand colors, typography, spacing
2. **Interaction fragmentation**: Different patterns for same action
3. **Accessibility gaps**: WCAG failures, missing alt text
4. **Technical design debt**: Hardcoded values, non-tokenized styles
5. **Research debt**: Assumptions without validation

### Debt Reduction Strategies

**Dedicated Allocation**
- Reserve 20% of design capacity for debt reduction
- "Fix-it Fridays" or similar rituals

**Incremental Improvement**
- "Scout rule": Leave every screen better than you found it
- Attach debt fixes to feature work

**Focused Sprints**
- Quarterly design debt sprint
- Prioritize by user impact and fix effort

### Debt Tracking
- Maintain design debt backlog in project management tool
- Tag by category, severity, and affected areas
- Review monthly in design leadership meeting
- Report on debt trends quarterly

## Crisis Management

### Design Escalation Path
1. Designer raises concern to manager
2. Manager assesses, involves director if cross-team
3. Director escalates to VP/executives if business-critical
4. Post-incident retrospective and process improvement

### Common Crisis Types

**Launch Quality Issues**
- Immediate: Hotfix critical bugs, communicate to users
- Short-term: QA process review, add design QA gate
- Long-term: Improve handoff and implementation fidelity

**Negative User Feedback Spike**
- Immediate: Acknowledge, gather specifics
- Short-term: Rapid research to understand root cause
- Long-term: Roadmap adjustment, communication plan

**Team Capacity Crunch**
- Immediate: Prioritize ruthlessly, cut scope
- Short-term: Bring in contractors, shift resources
- Long-term: Headcount planning, process efficiency
