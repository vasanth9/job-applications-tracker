# Team Structure & Hiring — Design Organization

## Team Models

### Centralized Model
All designers report to a central design org, assigned to product teams as needed.

**Pros**: Consistent quality, strong design culture, career growth paths, resource flexibility
**Cons**: Potential disconnect from product context, slower embedded relationships
**Best for**: Early-stage orgs, design-led companies, agencies

### Embedded Model
Designers report directly to product/engineering leaders within their product area.

**Pros**: Deep product context, fast decision-making, strong cross-functional bonds
**Cons**: Inconsistent practices, isolation, limited career growth, design debt
**Best for**: Large orgs with mature design practices, highly autonomous teams

### Hybrid Model (Recommended)
Designers embedded in product teams with dotted-line to central design leadership.

**Pros**: Best of both worlds—context + consistency
**Cons**: Matrix complexity, potential conflicting priorities
**Best for**: Scaling companies, multi-product organizations
